# OVERVIEW

Our project aims to develop a robust time series forecasting solution using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict stock prices based on historical data. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, we seek to address the challenges faced by investors and traders in accurately predicting future stock price movements. The project involves preprocessing historical stock price data, including relevant features such as open, high, low, and close prices, as well as trading volume. We will then design and train the RNN model architecture, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and optimizing performance through techniques like cross-validation and grid search. The trained model will be evaluated based on metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess its forecasting accuracy and reliability.

Through this project, we aim to provide investors and traders with a powerful forecasting tool that can generate accurate predictions of future stock prices, enabling them to make more informed investment decisions and maximize returns in the dynamic and unpredictable stock market environment. By harnessing the capabilities of deep learning and RNNs, our solution seeks to empower users with actionable insights and predictive intelligence to navigate the complexities of stock market investing with confidence and agility.
